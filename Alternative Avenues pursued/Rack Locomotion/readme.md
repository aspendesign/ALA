This is a possible locomotion alternative to a capstan drive. By using a gear rack on either bushings or rollers, one can have locomotion that is drift-free, as well as having shaft rotation be constrained by the pinion gear. Possible cons are cost, higher radial forces on motor bearings, and greater noise from straight cut gears, as well as lower actuation force due to high travel distance per revolution on typically available 1 mod racks.
